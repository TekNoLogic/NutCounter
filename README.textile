NutCounter is a basic AH stat addon inspired by Auctioneer's BeanCounter.  It strives for low resource use while keeping a few basic stats about your auctions:

* Sellthrough (percent of total auctions posted which were successful)
* Last sell price
* Min and max sell price

Note that due to the way the mailbox returns invoices, items are tracked by name not itemID.

NutCounter also implements the global API @GetAuctionBuyout(item)@.  This will prefer values provided by other addons that implement @GetAuctionBuyout@ first, if none are given it will return your last price from the item.
